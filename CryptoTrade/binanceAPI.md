HTTP 4XX return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
HTTP 403 return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
HTTP 409 return code is used when a cancelReplace order partially succeeds. (e.g. if the cancellation of the order fails but the new order placement succeeds.)
HTTP 429 return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
HTTP 418 return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 429 codes.
HTTP 5XX return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. It is important to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success.


Every request will contain X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
Each route has a weight which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier weight.
When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).
IP bans are tracked and scale in duration for repeat offenders, from 2 minutes to 3 days.
A Retry-After header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the number of seconds required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.

Endpoints share the 6,000 per minute limit based on IP.
